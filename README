NAME
     nova-install -- configure a fully functioning OpenStack Nova component

SYNOPSIS
     nova-install [-t type] [-V] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
     The nova-install command will gather information, install dependencies,
     and then configure one of a number of different OpenStack component
     types as specified on the command line.

     A cloud controller will be configured to run all five Nova services
     (api, compute, network, objectstor, and scheduler), while a compute
     node will only run Nova's compute service.

OPTIONS
     -t, --type <type>
          Changes the type of component to install. Currently implemented
          types are 'cloud' (default) for installing a new cloud
          controller, and 'compute' for installing a compute node for an
          existing cloud.

     -V, --version
          Print the nova-install script's version information and exit.

     -h, --help
